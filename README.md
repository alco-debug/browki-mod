MikeOS Browki Mod

The main difference with the [original](https://mikeos.sourceforge.net/) is my own point of view on some things. Currently, it is MikeBASIC interpreter put away from the kernel to the separate executable and menu shell being removed as an option of system UI (it still works in applications, cause system calls were not removed).
